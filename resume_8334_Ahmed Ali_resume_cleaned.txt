• PROJECTS
AI-Powered Resume & Skill-Gap Analyzer | React, TailwindCSS, FastAPI, Python, OpenAI API, LLM​
• GitHub
●​
Led a 4-member team to build an AI platform that parses résumés and job descriptions to assess skill gaps, compute
match scores, and recommend personalized learning paths.
●​
Engineered robust PDF-parsing/OCR pipelines (PyPDF2, PyMuPDF, pytesseract) for accurate text extraction and AI-driven
skill inference.
●​
Architected and deployed a decoupled React + FastAPI system with a responsive TailwindCSS UI and RESTful backend,
integrating OpenAI LLMs for automated skill-matching and adaptive cover-letter generation.
●​
Delivered a production-ready platform adopted by 300+ CUNY students, enhancing their internship readiness through
personalized skill-gap analysis, course recommendations, and project-based upskilling.
Spam Email Classifier & Model Analysis| Python, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas. xgboost, imblearn, matplotlib, seaborn GitHub
●​
Collaborated in a team of 4 to build a supervised learning pipeline that classifies spam emails using models such as
Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM.
●​
Built a spam email classifier using NLP (tokenization, stopword removal), reducing false positives by 15% and improving
communication accuracy.
●​
• Rectified skewed dataset of spam emails by employing SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), which
synthesized 2,000+ new data points, balancing class distribution and improving the model's predictive accuracy.
●​
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, F1-score, and confusion matrix, achieving up to 98% accuracy.
Local Business Finder & Travel Itinerary Planner | React, Node.js, Google Maps API, MongoDB ​
GitHub
●​
Built an interactive frontend in React and a scalable backend in Node.js with MongoDB.
●​
Integrated Google Maps API for geolocation and route optimization.
●​
Designed UI/UX in Figma and handled 100+ daily queries in the first deployment.
• EXPERIENCE
